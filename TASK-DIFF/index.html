<p>Initially dedicated to handle large scale point-based models, the 4D platform developed at the DHLAB with the collaboration of Cadastre Suisse introduced an optimized Earth-attached indexation formalism. As the data access and broadcast performances were encouraging, it was decided to adapt the indexation formalism for vector-based models allowing the platform to ingest, store and broadcast any type of 3D data.</p>
<p>In the context of differences detection and as the indexation formalism is based on equivalences classes defined on space and time, the space-time is naturally discretized along all of the four dimensions. This allowed to implements simple logical operators on the four-dimensional space. The OR, AND and XOR operators were then implemented allowing the platform to compute, on the fly, convolutions of models to compare one place at two different times.</p>
<p>The implementation of theses operators was simple due to the natural spatiotemporal discretization obtained from the indexation formalism. Nevertheless, two major drawbacks appeared : the first one is that such operator only works for point-based models. Having the possibility to compute and render differences and similarities between any type of data is not possible with such formal operators.</p>
<p>The second drawback comes from the nature of the point-based capturing devices. Indeed, taking the example of a building, even without any change to its structure, two digitization campaigns can lead to disparities only due to the point-based models sampling. The XOR operator is the natural choice to detect and render differences but this operator is very sensitive to sampling disparities. Computing the XOR convolution between two point-based models leads the rendering to be dominated by sampling variations rather than the desired structural differences.</p>
<p>This drawback was partially solved by considering the AND operator. Indeed, the AND operator allows to only shows constant structural elements from two different positions in time and is insensitive to sampling disparities. As shown on the following images, the AND operator shows differences as black spots (lack of data) :</p>

</p>
<br /></p>
<p>As one can see, AND convolution allows to detect, through the black spots, large area of structural changes between the two times and also, with more care, allows to guess more small differences.</p>
<p>The goal of this task is to tackle these two drawbacks allowing the platform to detect changes not only for point-based models but also for vector-based models and to show more clearly the differences between the compared to time positions.</p>
<p>The task consists then in the implementation, testing and validation of disparity and similarity detection algorithms for any type of data taken at two different times and to conduct a formal analysis on the best detection and rendering techniques.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A step by step methodology is defined to address the problem of differences and similarities detection in the platform. In a first phase, a first algorithm will be developed and validated on vector-based models as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development of the algorithm on synthetic variations on a vector-based model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validation of the algorithm (using the known synthetic variations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First conclusion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a second phase, <em>true</em> land register data will be used to formally detect real evolution of the territory and to compare them with the land register databases :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Obtaining <em>true</em> land register vector-based model (INTERLIS) at two different times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detecting the differences with the algorithm and validate them with the <em>true</em> land register revision</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a third phase, the algorithm will be validated (and adapted) to work on point-based models :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Obtaining <em>true</em> land register point-based model (LAS) at two different times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detecting the differences between the two times and validate them with the <em>true</em> land register revision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second conclusion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in a last phase, both point-based and vector-based models will be considered without distinction to develop an algorithm able to compare any type of data between themselves based on the conclusion made during the first algorithm development :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detection of differences/similarities on different type of data : flat land register (vector) and 3D models (point, mesh)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis and conclusion on the results of the developed algorithm</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the development of differences and similarities algorithms has to be conducted keeping in mind the possible future evolution of the platform such as addition of layers (separation of data), implementation of a multi-scale approach of the time dimension and addition of raster data in the platform.</p>

<p>In order to implements the first vector-based differences detection algorithm, sets of data are considered as base on which synthetic differences are applied to simulate the evolution of the territory. This approach allows to focus on well controlled data to formally benchmark the results of the implemented algorithms.</p>
<p>In addition, point-based models are also considered in order to determine in which extend the implemented vector-based differences detection algorithm can be operated on point clouds data with which results and performances.</p>

<h4 id="vector-models-line-based">Vector Models : Line-based<a class="headerlink" href="#vector-models-line-based" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In this first phase, line-based data are gathered from <em>openstreetmap</em> in order to create simple models used during the implementation and validation of the detection algorithms. A first set of vector-based models are considered made only of lines (land register). Three set are create each with a different scale, from cities to the whole Switzerland.</p>
<p>The line-based sets of data are extracted from <em>openstreetmap</em> shapefiles and the elevation is restored using the <em>SRTM geotiff</em> data. The <em>EGM96-5</em> geoid model is then used to convert the elevation from <em>MSL</em> to ellipsoid heights. The following images give an illustration of these sets of data :</p>

<i>Line-based dataset : Switzerland (top), canton of Neuchatel (bottom left) and Frauenfeld city (bottom right) - Data : OSM</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>In order to simulate evolution of the territory in time, synthetic variations are added to these models. A script is developed and used to insert controlled variations on selected primitives. The amount and the amplitude of these variations can also be controlled through the developed script.</p>
<h4 id="vector-models-triangle-based">Vector Models : Triangle-based<a class="headerlink" href="#vector-models-triangle-based" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A second set of triangle-based models is also considered to implement and validate the differences detection algorithm. The selected model is a mesh model of the building of Geneva City. It comes aligned in the CH1903+ frame with the altitudes. It is simply converted into the <em>WGS84</em> frame using again the <em>EGM95-5</em> geoid model :</p>

<br /></p>
<p>The developed script for line-based models is also used here to add synthetic variation to the model primitives in order to simulate an evolution of the territory.</p>
<h4 id="point-models-lidar">Point Models : LIDAR<a class="headerlink" href="#point-models-lidar" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A third set of point-based models are considered to be able how the developed algorithm is able to provide results on such models. A selected portion of the city of Geneva <em>LIDAR</em> is considered as illustrated on the following image :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">

<i>Point-based dataset : Geneva LIDAR - Data : SITG</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>In case of point-based models, taking into account the problem of sampling disparities that was experienced with the previously implemented <em>XOR</em> operator, two <em>true</em> case are here selected that are the <em>LIDAR</em> model in 2005 and 2009. This allows to apply the developed algorithm on <em>real</em> variations and to see how the sampling disparity is solved in case of such data.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-the-algorithm">Implementation of the Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-of-the-algorithm" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In order to compare two models at two different positions in time to detect differences, the solution is of course to search for each primitive of the first time if it has a correspondence in the second time. In such case, the primitives can be concluded as static in time and only the primitives that have no correspondence will be highlighted as differences.</p>
<p>A first approach was initially tested : a vertex-based comparison. As every primitive (points, lines and triangles) is supported by vertexes, it can be seen as a common denominator on which comparison can take place. Unfortunately, it is not a relevant approach as it leads to asymmetric detection algorithm. To illustrate the issue, the following image shows the situation of a group of primitives at two different times with an evolution on one of the primitive vertexes :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/asymetric-illustration.png?raw=true" width="400"> <br />
<i>Asymetric approach : the variation is detected only when comparing backward in time</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>When the comparison occurs between the second time compared to the first one, the modified vertex is not found in the first model, and then, the vertex can be highlighted as a difference. The asymmetry appears as the first time is compared to the second one. In this case, despite the primitive vertex changed, the vertex-based approach is able to find another vertex, part of another static primitive, and interprets it as a vertex identity, leading the modified primitive to be considered as static.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a fully symmetric algorithm, that does not depends on the way models are compared in times, a primitive based approach has to be considered. The implemented algorithm then treats the correspondence problem from the whole primitive point of view, by checking that the whole primitive can be found in the other model to which it is compared to. This allows to highlight any primitive showing a modification, regardless of the way models in time are compared.</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting the primitives that changed through time, the implemented algorithm also keeps the primitive that did not changed. The ensemble of primitives are then shown by modulating their color to emphasize the modification by keeping their original color for modified one while the static primitives are shown in dark gray. This allows to not only show the modifications but also to keep the context of the modification helping the user to fully understand the nature of the territory evolution.</p>
<p>Additional developments were required for triangle-based models : indeed, such models need to be subjected to a lighting model during rendering for the user to understand the model. As the differences are highlighted through color modulation, the implemented lighting model is causing difficulties to spot the highlighted primitives. The rendering client then checks for the differences detection algorithm and switches off the lighting in such case to make the differences more clear to the user.</p>
<p>In addition, mesh models, as they are made of triangles, are hiding parts of themselves. It can then be difficult for the user to spot the highlighted primitives as they can be <em>hidden</em> by others. An option was added to the rendering client allowing the user to ask the rendering of triangles as <em>line-loops</em> or points in order to make them transparent.</p>
<h3 id="experimentations-and-results">Experimentations and Results<a class="headerlink" href="#experimentations-and-results" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>With the implemented algorithm, a series of experimentations are conducted in order to validate and analyze the performance of the differences detection algorithm for vector-based models.</p>
<h4 id="differences-detection-and-rendering">Differences Detection and Rendering<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-detection-and-rendering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>With the implemented algorithms, it is possible to highlight any modification in the evolution of a model through time. The following image shows examples of modifications and how their are rendered for the user by the graphical client :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-example-line.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>Example of differences detection on Frauenfeld (left, two detections) and La Chaux-de-Fonds (right, one detection) - Data : OSM<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>Considering one of the two differences detected on the city of Frauenfeld, the following image shows the situation in the two compared models, at their respective position in time, that led to the detection :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-line-situation.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>First model situation (left) compared the the second model situation (right) - Data : OSM<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>One can see that, despite the modification of the primitive vertex is very small and difficult to see, the algorithm is able to detect it and to show the user where to look for evolutions. On this example, the shown evolution of the primitive vertex is of the order of <em>10</em> centimeters, leading to a very difficult difference to spot without the help of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Considering the triangle-based model, the following image shows how detected differences are rendered to the user :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-example-triangle.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>Example of differences detection on Geneva with filled (left) and line-loops (right) triangle rendering modes - Data : OSM<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>This shows how the differences detection algorithm is able to detect and render differences in a triangle-based model using the same color modulation technique as used for line-based models. One can see how rendering triangle as <em>line-loops</em> can ease the display of variations on triangle-based models allowing to see <em>through</em> the primitives.</p>
<p>In case of point-based models, considering the <em>true</em> evolutions provided by the selected dataset, one can clearly see that, despite the algorithm is able to perfectly reflects modification in vector-based models, it is dominated by sampling disparities in such case :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-example-point.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>Example of differences detection on point-based data being dominated by sampling disparities - Data : SITG<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>One can see on the right image above that large amount of the building are highlighted as modification while the building did not shown any structural evolution between 2005 and 2009. This illustrates how sampling disparities can dominate the differences detection leading to complicated rendering for the user.</p>
<p>The left image shows a larger view on which similar conclusion applies. The rendering is difficult to interpret for the user searching for territory evolutions. Nevertheless, it can be used as an educated guess to select area of changes. For example, the two following image illustrate how a large modification was discovered using the algorithm :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-example-point-close.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>Example of large territory evolution highlighted by the algorithm - Data : SITG<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>The following two images show the area structural situation in the 2005 and 2009 allowing to confirm the evolution of the territory :</p>
<p><br />
<p align="center">
<img src="image/diff-point-situation.jpg?raw=true" width="800"> <br />
<i>Structural situation of the detected evolution in 2005 (left) and 2009 (right) - Data : SITG<br />Right-click on the image and select "View Image" for full resolution</i>
</p>
<br /></p>
<p>This specific example shows that large modifications of the territory can be detected on point-based models, but it also illustrates the limitations of the detection algorithm applied on such data. In order to detect the modification, the user must have some knowledge of what is a point cloud model and be aware of the effects of sampling disparities.</p>
